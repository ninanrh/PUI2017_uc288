Unisse's maps are very clear, showing the breakdown of waste type collection by community district in New York City. The quantile breaks 
chosen for the color scheme show each range of collected trash percentage while ensuring the same amount of data goes into each category,
showing which neigborhoods  throw away certain types of trash. The colors themselves are well chosen, along with the size and placement
of the legend. Another way to show these map could be smaller and side by side, provoking a more direct comparison between percentages 
rather than scrolling up and down. 

For the final graph, the colors are aesthetically nice and the bar graphs show a clear trend. However, the bars within each borough 
are not labelled by year making the graph confusing at first glance. Additionally, there appears to be a blue color in the graph
unaccounted for in the legend that would be helpful in clarifying. 

Overall, the plots clearly convey a multidimensional and potentially overwhelming dataset.
