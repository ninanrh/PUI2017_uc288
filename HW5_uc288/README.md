## Assignment 1: Test the z-test
I was initially working on the assignment on my own but noticed really weird p-values for my KS and AD tests for both distributions. I know based on the discussions in class, we were supposed to get high p-values because the distribution of the z-statistics of a high mean Poisson and Binomial distribution is quite similar to a Gaussian.

I shared my answers with **Andrew Guobing Chen** and he reminded me that the standard deviation of the Poisson distribution is the square root of the mean.

So I readjusted the values I had and recomputed for the z-statistics for both the Poisson and Binomial distributions and got a higher p-value for both tests.

## Assignment 2: Compare Tests for Goodness of fit


## Assignment 3: Investigate linear relationships between fire arm possession, homicides by fire arms, and mass shootings for different countries, considering also the country GDP
